Implemented a kernel-level C++ thread library on Unix from scratch, handling CPU booting, thread lifecycle management, multi (50+) CPU management, timer and inter-processor interrupts, atomicity, and FIFO thread scheduling order.

Added support for low level synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables that leverage an atomic guard variable to implement spinlocks for mutual exclusion in multi-core environments.
